    <h2>modern norfolk southern trains</h2>
    <p> The Norfolk Southern Railway (reporting mark NS) is a Class I freight railroad operating in the Eastern United States. Headquartered in Atlanta, the company was formed in 1982 with the merger of the Norfolk and Western Railway and Southern Railway.[4] The company operates 19,420 route miles (31,250 km) in 22 eastern states, the District of Columbia,[5] and has rights in Canada over the Albany to Montréal route of the Canadian Pacific Kansas City.[6][7] Norfolk Southern Railway is the leading subsidiary of the Norfolk Southern Corporation. Norfolk Southern is responsible for maintaining 28,400 miles (45,700 km), with the remainder being operated under trackage rights from other parties responsible for maintenance work.[8] Intermodal containers and trailers are the most common commodity type carried by NS, which have grown as the coal business has declined throughout the 21st century; coal was formerly the largest traffic source. The railway offers the largest intermodal rail network in eastern North America.[9] NS was also the pioneer of Roadrailer service. Norfolk Southern and its chief competitor, CSX Transportation, have a duopoly on the transcontinental freight rail lines in the Eastern United States.</p>

    <h3>modernizing Norfolk southern</h3>
    <p>Norfolk Southern plans to modernize 330 more locomotives with help from Wabtec as part of NS’ broader initiative to reduce carbon emissions and improve fuel efficiency.By modernizing the locomotive, fuel efficiency will improve by as much as 25%, reliability will increase by more than 40%, haulage ability will grow by up to 55%, and maintenance, repair and overhaul expenses will fall by 20%, NS said. Each modernized locomotive will also reduce its carbon emissions by more than 500 tons per year. NS said, “Modernizing locomotives in our fleet will improve operational performance and reliability,” said Tom Schnautz, NS vice president for advanced train control. “Importantly, it will also help us achieve our science-based target of a 42% reduction in emissions intensity by 2034. Wabtec’s proven modernization program allows us to maximize the value of our locomotives, minimize the use of new materials and reduce the environmental impact of our operations.”</p>
