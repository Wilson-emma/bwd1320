            <h1>Mr.President Scandal</h1>
            <p>For decades, rumors have swirled about Marilyn Monroe's involvement with both President John F. Kennedy and his younger brother, Senator Robert F. Kennedy. However, there was no evidence substantiating the rumors of an affair between Monroe and Robert Kennedy — that is, until 2016, when a letter came up for auction via Julien's Auctions.The letter, from the Kennedys' younger sister, Jean Kennedy Smith, to Monroe, reads, "Understand that you and Bobby are the new item," and "We all think you should come with him when he comes back East!" The letter was unearthed by David Strasberg, son of Lee Strasberg, Monroe's acting coach and to whom she left a number of her things. FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover had initiated an investigation into Monroe's and Robert's relationship. However, despite his best efforts — such as deploying his staff to watch Robert at parties — Hoover was never able to find anything to confirm his suspicions.</p>

            <p>While there was no formal confirmation when Marilyn was still alive, it is almost undeniable that she faced a rapid decline in her mental well-being around the 1950s as well as the early 1960s. One of the primary indicators (despite the surrounding conspiracies) is the fact she passed away from a probable suicide by overdosing on barbiturates in her Los Angeles home on August 4, 1962. The 36-year-old was actually addicted to these nervous system calmers, according to Donald Spoto’s ‘Marilyn Monroe: The Biography,‘ and was even prone to unexpected, dramatic mood swings. It’s thus imperative to note that Marilyn’s psychiatrist Dr. Ralph Greenson once reportedly suggested she could have (early-stage) schizophrenia, like her biological mother Gladys Pearl Baker. However, with the medical advancements over the years, it’s now speculated the actress actually suffered from the emotional dysregulation condition called Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD).</p>

    <h2>Monroe's death</h2>
    <p>On the evening of August 4, 1962, American actress Marilyn Monroe died at age 36 of a barbiturate overdose inside her home at 12305 Fifth Helena Drive in Brentwood, Los Angeles, California. Her body was discovered before dawn the following morning, on August 5. Monroe had been one of the most popular Hollywood stars during the 1950s and early 1960s, and was a top-billed actress for the preceding decade. Her films had grossed $200 million by the time of her death. At approximately 3 a.m. on Sunday, August 5, Murray noticed that Monroe had locked herself in her bedroom and appeared unresponsive when she looked inside through a window. Murray alerted Greenson, who arrived soon after, entered the room by breaking a window, and found Monroe dead. Her death was officially ruled a probable suicide by the Los Angeles County coroner's office, based on information about her overdosing and being prone to mood swings and suicidal ideation. No evidence of foul play was found, and accidental overdose was ruled out because of the large amount of barbiturates she had ingested.</p>

    <h3>Why she did it</h3>
    <p>For several years heading into the early 1960s, Marilyn Monroe had been dependent on amphetamines, barbiturates and alcohol, and she experienced various mental health problems that included depression, anxiety, low self-esteem and chronic insomnia.[2] Monroe had acquired a reputation for being difficult to work with, and she frequently delayed productions by being late to film sets in addition to having trouble remembering her lines.[3] She also had an FBI file open since 1956 due to her "problematic" relationships with accused communists.</p>
