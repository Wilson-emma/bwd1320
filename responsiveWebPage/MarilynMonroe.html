            <p>Marilyn Monroe was an American actress, model, and singer1. She is known for playing comic "blonde bombshell" characters, and became one of the most popular sex symbols of the 1950s and early 1960s, as well as an emblem of the era's sexual revolution1. Her films grossed more than $200 million2. Monroe found work as a “pin-up” model in the mid-1940s, and then had small roles in film. In the early ‘50s, Monroe gained more recognition as an actress, and by the mid-’50s she was a household name and “sex symbol”.</p>

            </h2>
            <p>In 1962 Monroe began filming the comedy Something’s Got to Give.In their first runs, Monroe’s 23 movies grossed a total of more than $200 million, and her fame surpassed that of any other entertainer of her time. Her early image as a dumb and seductive blonde gave way in later years to the tragic figure of a sensitive and insecure woman unable to escape the pressures of Hollywood. Her vulnerability and sensuousness combined with her needless death eventually raised her to the status of an American cultural icon.</p>
